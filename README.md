# Limit Texture Size in Eevee
Adds a subpanel to the Eevee Simplify panel allowing you to limit texture sizes.

## Changelog
1.1 - Moved texture limit menu from 3D view to the Eevee Simplify panel
1.0 - Initial release

## Known Limititations
When turning Simplify off, the texture limit is set to off, but stays off when reenabling Simplify. I'm working to fix this. You can still manually set your texture limit when enabling Simplify.
